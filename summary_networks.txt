The repository on git contains the file DM_tasks_and_in_conditions.tar.xz. It has the data for the ratios I-E and graphs of the eigenvalue distributions for each task and condition.
The plots_comparizon_*.tar.xz files contain additional information with graphs, including comparisons for the same task and the initial condition of the different networks in the same plot.
The provided code allows you to generate networks for any of the mentioned tasks and compositions. However, if necessary, the trained networks are available for each task and initial condition. But since they are large files, the git system does not allow all of them to be placed in the repository. If necessary, it can be requested to the authors by referring to the type of task, composition and number associated with each graph. They are numbered in the graphs of the plots_comparizon_*.tar.xz files. For example: network "5", 50-50 I-E,  orthogonal.
